### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Since July 2024, I am a researcher at TII, UAE, working on LLMs. Before that, I graduated in June 2024 from a PhD in Machine Learning at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) Abu Dhabi, UAE, under the supervision of Dr. [Bin Gu](https://jsgubin.github.io/), where I was working on optimization for machine learning, in particular on zeroth-order optimization, and sparse learning. Before that, I graduated with an MSc. from [SupÃ©lec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sup%C3%A9lec) in 2016 (now part of [CentraleSupelec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentraleSup%C3%A9lec) and [Paris Saclay University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University)), and have worked at [Sidetrade](https://www.sidetrade.com/) as a data scientist (2016-2017), at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) in the [Magnet](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) Team as a research engineer (2017-2019), and at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) in the Paris Research and Algorithmic Lab as a PhD student (2019-2021).
