### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am William de Vazelhes, PhD candidate at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) in Machine Learning, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, with an expected graduation date of **June 2024**. I am currently working on optimization for machine learning, in particular on zeroth-order optimization, and sparse learning.
