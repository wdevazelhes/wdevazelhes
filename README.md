### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Since April 2025, I am a research engineer at <a href=https://genbio.ai>GenBio AI</a>, working on pre-training foundation models for biology. Before that, I was a researcher at <a href="https://www.tii.ae/">TII</a>, working on various aspects of LLMs such as optimization for pre-training, and distillation. Before that, I graduated in June 2024 from a PhD in Machine Learning from <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a>, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, under the supervision of Pr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vo8OgCgAAAAJ&hl=en">Bin Gu</a>, where I was working on optimization for machine learning, in particular on zeroth-order optimization, and sparse learning. I also worked with Pr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xtyuan1980/home">Xiao-Tong Yuan</a> on several projects. Before that, I graduated with an MSc. from [SupÃ©lec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sup%C3%A9lec) in 2016 (now part of [CentraleSupelec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentraleSup%C3%A9lec) and [Paris Saclay University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University)), and have worked at [Sidetrade](https://www.sidetrade.com/) as a data scientist (2016-2017), at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) in the [Magnet](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) Team as a research engineer (2017-2019), and at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) in the Paris Research and Algorithmic Lab as a PhD student (2019-2021).
